		<li>Cry Companions satisfies all my crying needs.  I would definitely recommend to all my sad friends!</li>
		<li>I used to feel so insecure about crying in public, which made me cry even more…now no one even notices me.  Thanks, Cry Companions!</li>
		<li>These products make it so easy and convenient to burst into tears at a moment’s notice.  Now that I’ve found them, I can’t imagine my life without them!</li>
		<li>Everyone knows crying in public is the worst, but with these, no one has to know! </li>
		<li>These items are just perfect!  As a junior software developer, I cry A LOT (pretty much everyday).  Now, I don’t have to hold it in until I’m in the shower!</li>
